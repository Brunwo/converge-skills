should have an interactive merge resolution when skills are merged.  : 
detect semantic conflicts / contredictions : 
 - propose user : versionning  / splitting  : will split to different branches / semantic versions (diff could be related and explained by env specific needs (versions of tools / systems etc..))
 if versionning : meaning old instructions will be replaced by user selected version, and tag / version defined

 idea is to keep git branching structure as good visualization for our skills tracability / evolution : using all what git offers : branches names , tags for best interpretability.

 semantic merging can be done by an llm is a sub taks (own separate context windows, providing only dirs to merge as context, providing basic files tooling : ls / tree / head tail cat etc..)


keep in mind that skills are going to be injected in normal git projects in special skills folder , updates to those skills can be pushed upstream, shared, but also become specific to envs.. think about long term maintainability, skills trees should always aspire to merge / fusion with existing ones, so that tree does not grow infinitely
